This project was built to suit the needs of Byron and his needs keep track of his contacts and where they live. Shout out to Byron's Grandma for helping me out with some API's and frameworks.

##Features

* Contacts are cards that can be moved and sorted.
* Drag contacts into the category tabs to add them to that category
* Remove the contact from the category by going to that category and pressing "remove from category" on that card.
* Add new Contacts and Categories
* Edit each card by pressing "edit" on that card
* Delete a contact by pressing the "X" on each card
* Keep track of your contacts most lived in cities by going to the analytics
